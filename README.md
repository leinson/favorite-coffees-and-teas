A web application, where you can keep track of your favorite coffees and teas. 

Frontend with Vite+React+Typescript and backend with Node.js+Typescript. Versions: node v20.1.0 & npm v9.6.4. The UI is implemented with the Material UI (MUI) library.

## Install

Open two terminals, and move to frontend folder in one and to the backend folder in the other.
Run app: `npm run dev` in both backend&frontend terminals
Click open the frontend localhost adress 3001.

## Limitations and future development: 

Due to the time constraint, many parts of the app needs to be developed further. 
- Visual UI: improvements to overall look, align elements on the page better, improved mobile view
- Proper input validation checking
- Permanent saving to file or database
- Refactoring of code: splitting it to smaller components, e.g. the Form
- Separate Coffee & Tea favorite list, or the ability to toggle which all to show
- Better use of Typescript
